    [H3]S-Type Racing Sloop[h3]

The Nubia Star Drives S-type Racing Sloop is one of the latest racing vessels created by the design collective and offered to discriminating buyers. Built entirely for interstellar racing, these ships have nevertheless found a valuable niche as couriers for sensitive messages and high-value, extremely compact cargos. 

[P]These ships feature long, narrow, and blocky hulls that sweep backwards into large engines built into the hull above and below the inset cockpit. The cockpit holds a pilot, navigator, and can also carry two passengers in foldable jump-seats (although this space is often used by experienced racers to store food or supplies). The entire living space is horribly cramped, and traveling long distances quickly becomes an ordeal. 

[P]In tandem, the engines can accelerate the vessel to incredible speeds. However, this stretches the Racing Sloop's power plant to the maximum. Little remains for shields, and none for weapons.</Description>
