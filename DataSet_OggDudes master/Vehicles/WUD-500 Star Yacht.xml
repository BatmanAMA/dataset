  <Description>[H3]CEC WUD-500 Star Yacht[h3]

A luxury craft intended to complement Corellian Engineering Company's extensive line of light freighters, the WUD-500 star yacht was engineered with features and design principles directly inspired by the highly successful YT-series. Smaller than the YT-1300, the WUD-500 has a saucer-shaped hull with an in-line cockpit jutting from the front. Though fast and highly customizable, the WUD-500 proved relatively unpopular outside of the Corellian sector and was unable to compete with more well-known luxury yachts from SoroSuub and Kuat Drive Yards. Eventually discontinued, the WUD-500 found renewed life on the aftermarket among smugglers and free traders.</Description>
