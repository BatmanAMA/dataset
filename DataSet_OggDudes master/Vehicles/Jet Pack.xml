  <Description>[H3]Jet Pack[h3]

A jet pack is ideal for fast maneuverability and surprise
attacks. Most use small thrusters to blast into the air
for short periods, though some augment this with anti-grav devices. Their only drawbacks are their large size and weight, limited fuel, and the not inconsiderable skill needed to pilot them safely. 
[P]The Z-6 uses an air-breathing jet turbine to propel the user, maintaining stability via directional exhaust nozzles and a gyro-stabilizer. The pilot uses a verbal control interface and wrist controls to fly the jet pack.
[P]A jet pack allows a person to function as a Silhouette 1, Speed 2, Handling 0, System Strain Threshold 3 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate.
[P][B]Models Include:[b] Mitrinomon Z-6 Jet Pack.
