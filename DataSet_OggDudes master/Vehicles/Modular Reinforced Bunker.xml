  <Description>[H3]BKR B-70 Modular Reinforced Bunker[h3]

The
B-70 MRB is made from far sturdier materials
than are Delvinâ€™s other modular structures.
Constructed of reinforced, armorplast-faced ferrocrete,
the MRB can be configured as a sealed
bunker, open-topped fortification, or weapon
emplacement, or as a protective structure to
house power generators, shield generators, or
other important base structures. The B-70 can
hold six average-sized humanoids or one large
piece of equipment like a turbolaser emplacement
or shield generator. It provides 2 ranged
defense to any individual or materiel inside.
[P][I]Disclaimer: This is a piece of field equipment found in the Lead by Example Sourcebook.  It is created as a stationary "vehicle" because it is the most appropriate format.  While any mods or benefits are per the official source, the actual vehicle stats are an interpretation only and are not official.  Feel free to modify them if you think any changes are required.[i]</Description>
