    [H3]TIE/SH VIP Shuttle[h3]

The TIE/sa is, perhaps, the most versatile of the TIE starfighters. With its second hull and modular components supplied by SFS, the TIE/sa can be converted to a number of different configurations. Two of the more common are the /sh VIP shuttle and the /br boarding shuttle. The VIP shuttle replaces the ordnance launchers and the bomb delivery system with a small, well-appointed passenger pod suitable for up to four individuals. These small craft are typically used as ships' boats to ferry admirals, captains, and other high-ranking Imperial Navy officers to and from their commands. The TIE/br trades the heavy ordnance for an extended passenger pod capable of carrying a full squad of stormtroopers and all of their equipment. The pod is also equipped with a forward boarding hatch with docking clamps and powerful plasma cutters for cutting through ship hulls. These variants have the same performance characteristics as the standard TIE/sa, and the TIE/sh mounts a shield generator that provides defense value of 1/1.</Description>
