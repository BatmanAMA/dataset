    [H3]Ne-4 Cloud Car Interceptor[h3]

The Needle is a surprisingly speedy, high-altitude patrol ship designed to arrive on target absolutely as fast as possible. True to its name, it has a narrow, tapered profile and a low bubble canopy. Its powerful engines are notoriously temperamental. The ship trades speed for maneuverability and armor, and takes catastrophic damage at a much higher rate as a result. 

[P]Bespin and high-altitude stations and cities deploy the Needle as a counter to smugglers and criminals flying vessels faster than the average cloud car or patrol ship. However, the criminals and smugglers themselves have taken a liking to the ship's speed, and are known to fly a few of their own. An illegal racing circuit has also sprung up, with contestants racing around and through massive cloud structures and storms on gas giants.</Description>
