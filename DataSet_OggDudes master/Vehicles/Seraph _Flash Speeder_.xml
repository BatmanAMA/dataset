    [H3]Seraph "Flash Speeder"[h3]

The Seraph-class landspeeder, colloquially known as the "Flash Speeder," is a small, relatively common model produced by the SoroSuub Corporation. Popular on Corellia for its compact size and speed, the Flash Speeder is a common sight on the streets of Coronet City and other cities, as well as rural areas of the planet. The Seraph is operated by a single driver, with room for three passengers in its open-topped interior. A pair of triple-drive turbine engine pods, which are mounted on an airfoil at the rear of the speeder, provide excellent speed and maneuverability. 

[P]CorSec utilizes an armed version of the Flash Speeder for security, patrol, and pursuit duty, mounting a light blaster cannon on a rotating swivel atop the rear spoiler.</Description>
