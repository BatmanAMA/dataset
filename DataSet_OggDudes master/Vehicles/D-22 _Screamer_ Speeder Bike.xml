    [H3]CEC D-22 "Screamer" Speeder Bike[h3]

One of the most popular speeder bikes on Corellia, the D-22 "Screamer" appeals to the lust for speed that lurks in the heart of every Corellian. Insanely fast, the D-22 is barely more than an overpowered repulsor engine with saddle, a pair of handles, and control vanes attached. Designed around Incom's HpTI 0 repulsorlift engine (intended for use in high-performance airspeeders), the Screamer is built for speed, with minimal frills. The D-22 is also used by CorSec as a pursuit vehicle, in which case it carries an underslung light repeating blaster.</Description>
