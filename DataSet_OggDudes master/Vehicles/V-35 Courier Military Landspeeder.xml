  <Description>[H3]V-35 Courier Military Landspeeder[h3]

A common sight throughout the galaxy, the V-35 courier is a simple, durable craft useful in a variety of situations. Designed as a family vehicle, the model's popularity and staying power have led to the speeders being put to nearly every use imaginable at one point or another. The V-35 is easy to maintain, even in harsh conditions. The small, roof-mounted scanner scope assists navigation in poor visibility. The V-35's simplicity and practicality make it the choice of innumerable Rebel cells and operations, especially those where blending in to local traffic is a priority. The craft's only notable weakness is its limited top speed, which is approximately half that of comparable models.</Description>
