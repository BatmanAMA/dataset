    [H3]Superflare/Modified Flare-S Swoop[h3]

Pairing a massive auto-blaster with one of the galaxy's fastest swoops, the Superflare is a blazingly fast weapon system that is wickedly dangerous for both the enemy and its own pilot. The customized configuration takes full advantage of the Flare-S' high-performance repulsorlift engine to bring unique mobility to a weapon that is normally found on larger craft. 

[P]This combination of power has its drawbacks, so much so that some pilots call it the Flameout. First, the swoop's handling is significantly impacted by the added weight and power needs. Second, the vehicle doesn't generate enough power for consistent use of the Auto-Blaster, and must recharge between shots. Unfortunately, while the weapon is charging, it also saps the swoop's power, dropping its speed by one for three rounds. Third, the sudden power spikes and drops generated by the gun can affect the swoop mid-flight, causing stalls or sudden changes in speed or altitude. Even skilled pilots can find themselves at the mercy of a bucking bike that suddenly has a mind of its own at terrifying speeds.</Description>
