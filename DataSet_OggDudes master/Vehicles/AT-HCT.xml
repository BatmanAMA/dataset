    [H3]AT-HCT[h3]

A derivative of the popular AT-EST, Rothana Heavy Engineering's All Terrain Heavy Civilian Transport has served the needs of isolated colonies for decades. Designed for simplicity and versatility, the AT-HCT resembles an eight-legged beast of burden. A single driver controls the vehicle from a saddle-seat mounted off its front. Behind the driver, the rest of the AT-HCT consists of a single open-topped bed. The vehicle is not flashy, fast. or particularly combat-capable, but it is tough and durable, and it can carry a great deal of cargo over lone distances.</Description>
