  <Name>Maelstrom-Class Battle Cruiser</Name>
  <Description>[H3][I]Maelstrom[i] -Class Battle Cruiser[h3]
The Maelstrom-class battle cruiser belongs to the
family of dagger-shaped proto-Star Destroyers,
such as the Venator and Acclamator classes, used by
the Republic Navy at the outset of the Clone Wars.
Designed as much to inspire awe in allies and dread in
enemies as to fight, these massive and imposing vessels
have a long, thin, and heavily armored cranked
delta hull and graceful twin command suites positioned
aft over the main drives. At the time of their introduction,
the Maelstroms were the largest, and arguably
most impressive, vessels in the Republic Navy. Armed
to the teeth and heavily armored, they were optimized
for fleet command duties, with additional fleet carrier
and planetary siege capabilities. They carried an
entire wing of starfighters—1 20 ships and their attendant
support staff and facilities—and a full army of
clones with weapons, vehicles, and assorted gear, and
they were equipped with sophisticated command and
control systems that granted the ship’s Commander a
near-limitless view of the theater of command.
[P]Along with their impressive complement of starfighters
and ground forces, the Maelstroms carry a staggering
amount of firepower to operate in their planetary
bombardment role. They mount various multibarrel
turbolaser batteries in both broadside turrets and
fixed forward emplacements. Smaller, lighter weapons
and torpedo launchers provide anti-starfighter and
anti-gunboat fire for those small ships that slip through
the Maelstrom's prodigious fighter screen. The showpiece
of the vessel’s armament, however, is its array
of heavy assault concussion missile launchers, used for
planetary bombardment and anti-space station operations.
With their thick armor and powerful shields, the
Maelstrom-class ships were incredibly tough nuts to
crack, and they fulfilled their roles very well.
[P]Unfortunately, for the Maelstrom-class ships and their
crews, at least, these vessels proved unpopular and
were phased out of use soon after their introduction. By
that time, the Clone Wars had entered their final phase.
Newer, faster ships were coming out of KDY, including
the innovative Victory-class vessels, and the Maelstroms
were never really deployed in their intended
roles. They required a massive amount of resources to
keep running and were generally seen as too expensive
to operate, despite their vast power. Maelstrom,
the lead ship of the class, served with distinction at the
Battle of Kromus and the Battle of Cularin under the
command of Jedi general Darrus Jeht, but most of the
others never saw combat. Eventually, with the end of
the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire, bringing with
it a reorganization of the Navy, the Maelstroms remaining
in service were either broken up, used as technology
test beds, or laid up in mothballs. A handful of these
mothballed ships still exist, and at least one of them,
a scarred old warhorse named Simoom, has found a
home in the Alliance Navy.</Description>
