  <Description>
      [H3]ILH-KK Citadel-Class Light Freighter[h3]

Produced by Koensayr, a company known more for its starfighters and starship components than for cargo ships, the Citadel-class is a small, relatively fast freighter built to compete with CEC's VT and W class of light freighters. Known for their ruggedness and reliability, these ships have a broad, flat hull reminiscent of the Imperial Navy's Lambda-class shuttle with two long, side-mounted vertical stabilizers aft and a short, thick stabilizer mounted between that holds the ship's transponder and comms array. The forward hull section houses the bridge and living quarters for the three-person crew, with more cabins behind for passengers. Quite heavily armored for a ship of this size and class, and equipped with military-grade shields, Citadels have gained a reputation for being able to absorb incredible amounts of punishment and still deliver their passengers and cargo safely.

[P]While Citadels are, on paper, passenger carriers, they are remarkably well armed for their role. Due to their heavy weapons load-out, their powerful KM-440.a1 reactor, and midships external docking clamps that can easily be used to carry two starfighters, many have been re-purposed as fighting ships. Many of these reconfigured ships have found their way into the hands of freebooters and smugglers.</Description>
